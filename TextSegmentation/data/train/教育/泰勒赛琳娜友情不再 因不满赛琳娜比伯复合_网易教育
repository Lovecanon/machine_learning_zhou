泰勒赛琳娜友情不再 因不满赛琳娜比伯复合_网易教育

They were once so close that Taylor Swift dubbed Selena Gomez 'the closest thing I have to a sister'.泰勒·斯威夫特和赛琳娜·戈麦斯曾经一度交情甚好，泰勒甚至把赛琳娜成为关系最亲密的一位妹妹。
But Taylor has reportedly ditched her best friend following her decision to reunite with bad boy ex Justin Bieber.但是最近据报道，因为赛琳娜打算与“坏小子"——前男友贾斯汀·比伯复合，使得泰勒与昔日最好的朋友赛琳娜分道扬镳。
Swift disapproves of her Come And Get It pal's decision to get back together with the troubled Baby hitmaker, following his recent legal troubles and hard-partying reputation.泰勒相当不赞同赛琳娜所作的决定，她不希望赛琳娜再与那个老是惹麻烦的比伯在一起，他最近惹上了不少法律纠纷，还日日买醉狂欢，名声很不好。

Sources told Us Magazine that Taylor had begun distancing herself following Selena'a brief relationship with Ed Sheeran last year.据消息，自从去年赛琳娜与艾德·希兰有过一段短暂的恋情，泰勒就已经疏离了赛琳娜。
Sheeran is also a close friend of Taylor's and Swift felt he was used by Selena to make Beiber jealous.因为希兰也是泰勒的好朋友，她认为赛琳娜利用了希兰，只是为了让比伯嫉妒。
And, the magazine revealed, the news that Selena and Bieber had spent the past weekend together was the final straw for Taylor - who is 'disgusted' by her former pal's decision.报刊继续揭露到，赛琳娜和比伯共度上周末这件事彻底刺激到了泰勒，她认为她昔日的姐妹做的这个复合决定“太令人反感了”。
The girls were once close friends. Selena said last August: 'I think girls need to be more supportive of each other. I definitely agree with that. I'm all about that.这两位女孩曾经是感情超好的闺蜜。赛琳娜去年八月写到：“我觉得女生之间需要互相支持。我非常赞成这种说法，我也有很多很支持我的闺蜜。”



 
'Taylor has been one of those girls. We have been friends for five years. She is very strong. She doesn't care what people think and she inspires me.'“泰勒曾是其中之一，我们的友谊有五年之久了。她内心很坚强，她不在乎别人怎么想，这一点深深地鼓舞了我。”
The two were seen giggling together at the MTV VMAs last May, and enjoyed a girly sleepover together as recently as December.而去年五月她们在VMA颁奖礼上在一起笑得很开心。而在最近十二月，她们还共度了“女孩之夜”，关系亲密。
