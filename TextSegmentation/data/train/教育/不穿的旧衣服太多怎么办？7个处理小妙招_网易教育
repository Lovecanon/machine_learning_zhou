1. Give to friends

送给朋友

An easy way to recycle old clothes that you consider past their wear date, but are still in good condition, is to pass them on to friends. For them, they could be exciting ‘new additions’ for their wardrobe, especially if the clothing suits their style of dressing. They will appreciate your gesture and the fact that you will be saving them money. Don’t forget that item you found lurking at the back of your closet may well be considered on trend again now.
如果你认为旧衣服过了穿着时段，但它们仍保养得很好，那么重复利用旧衣服的一个简单方法就是把它们送给你的朋友。对朋友来说，这“额外的赠予”会让他们兴奋起来，尤其是当衣服符合他们的穿衣风格。他们会感激你的举动，同时也谢谢你让他们省了一笔钱。别忘了隐藏在你衣柜里的那些物品，它们可能会再度盛行。

2. Give to good causes
捐赠给慈善事业

Recycle clothes by donating them to your local thrift shops or charity organizations. These places aren’t a dumping ground for rubbish � the clothing should still be of use, but also remember that even if an item is stained, torn or lightly damaged, it can be given a new lease of life at a textile recovery facility.
还有一种做法是把它们捐赠给当地的旧货店或慈善机构。这些地方不是垃圾处理厂――你应该保证捐赠的衣服依旧还能穿着，但也请记住，即使有件衣服弄脏了、撕破了或有一点点的磨损，经纺织品返修设备一修补，就能成为一件新的。

3. Give to clothes recycling centers
送到服装回收处理中心

Textile recycling recovery facilities sort out items of clothing according to their condition, fabric, type and also refurbish handbags, belts, shoes and hats. They separate the recycled clothing into useful items for distribution to countries worldwide. Some are used again in innovative ways � even tennis balls are made out of recycled clothing.
根据衣服的质地、面料和类型，纺织品循环利用处理中心会将衣服进行分类，此外他们还可以分类翻新过的手袋、腰带、鞋子和帽子。他们从可回收的衣服中分拣出有用的物品，并将这些物品分配到世界各国。有些会经过创新后再度投入使用――连网球都是由回收的衣服制成的。


4. Reuse around the house
家居用品再利用

One of the simplest and cost-saving ways to recycle clothes is to use articles of soft clothing as polishing cloths, dusters, car and window cleaning materials, drying-up towels and for many other and varied purposes. Recycling is a great way to help the planet’s environment problems.
一个最简单又节约成本的方法是把那些软的布料用作擦拭布、抹布、用在汽车和窗户上的清洁布、擦干布以及许多其它各种不同的用途。回收是解决地球环境问题的一个重要方法。

5. Get crafty
巧手制作

Soft cuddly toys like rag dolls and soft teddy bears can be produced out of recycled clothing. Children outgrow their clothes quickly but so many items are in perfect condition that is ideal for further usage. Old clothes can be reused for the bodies of toys or for the stuffing. If you’re feeling crafty, cut material from old clothing into equal strips and reuse them by weaving into shapes to make purses, or even turn them into shopping bags. Bibs, feeders, patchwork quilts and even wall hangings are other methods of recycling old clothes.
柔软又可爱的玩具，像布娃娃和柔软的泰迪熊，就可以用回收的服装来制作。孩子们的衣服很快就不能穿了，但是衣服上有很多地方却仍保持完好，它们是可以进一步循环利用的理想之选。旧衣服可以重复使用作为玩具的身体部位或是填充物。如果你有奇思妙想，从旧衣服上剪下同等大小的条形布条，再把它们缝成各种形状，进而做成钱包，甚至是购物袋。围嘴、奶瓶、小块布缝缀的被罩，甚至是墙壁上的帘布，这些都是重复利用旧衣服的方法。

6. Sell them
出售

Selling your unwanted items to shops that specialize in selling fashionable recycled clothes can earn you some extra money. They sell on a consignment basis and take a reasonable commission on sale. You might also find something that you want there, so it becomes a worthwhile exchange and a benefit for your wardrobe.
有一些商店专门出售回收的时尚服装。你把不需要的东西卖给这些商店可以赚取一些外快。他们采用代销方式，收取合理的销售佣金。也许你在那里也能找到你想要的东西，所以在那里你可以交换到一些有价值的东西，对你的衣柜来说也是一大福音。

7. Swap them
互相交换


 

One of the most fun ways of recycling unwanted clothes is to get the girls together for a swap meet. Get your BFFs to sort out their unwanted stuff and all gather in one place for a mega swap session. Get in some wine and nibbles and make it a fun girls night in.
最有趣的其中一种方法是把女孩们聚在一起来个交换联谊会。让你的死党们将她们不想要的东西分类好，然后聚在一个地方来次盛大的交换会。带些酒和小点心，办一个女孩欢乐夜！
